🚀 **Supercharge Your Cloud Management with the AWS MCP Server!**

Are you tired of endlessly clicking through the AWS Management Console? Struggling to keep track of resources, costs, and security across multiple accounts?

I'm excited to share the **AWS MCP Server**—a powerful open-source tool that bridges your AI assistant (like Claude or Gemini) directly to your AWS environment using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

� **The Problem it Solves: Context Switching & Visibility**
We've all been there: You manage a **Master Account** with multiple **Child Accounts** (Dev, Staging, Prod).
To check a simple thing like *"Which production instances are stopped?"* or *"What's the cost anomaly in Staging?"*, you have to:

1. Log out of one account.
2. Log into another.
3. Navigate 5 different dashboards.
4. Manually paste data into a spreadsheet.

It’s slow, tedious, and error-prone.

🛠 **The Solution: Chat with Your Cloud**
The AWS MCP Server gives your AI direct, read-only access to your AWS SDK. Instead of clicking, you simply ask:

> 🗣️ *"Check cost anomalies across all my child accounts for the last 24 hours."*
> 🗣️ *"List all EC2 instances in the Production account that are currently stopped."*
> 🗣️ *"Are there any S3 buckets in the Dev account with public access?"*

The AI queries the AWS APIs in real-time and gives you an instant, data-backed summary. It acts as your 24/7 Cloud Analyst.

⚙️ **How it Works & Key Features**
Built with TypeScript and the AWS SDK v3, it runs locally or on your server and exposes "tools" that the AI can call safely.

* 💰 **Cost Intelligence**: Analyze spend, forecasts, and anomalies instantly.
* 🛡️ **Security Posture**: Audit security groups, IAM users, and WAF rules.
* 📦 **Resource Visibility**: List and inspect EC2, Lambda, and more without opening the console.

**Why use it?**
Because you should spend your time architecting and building, not navigating menus.
